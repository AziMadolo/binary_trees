Project: 0x1D. C - Binary trees

In this project, we delved into the intricacies of utilizing trees as data structures. We explored their specific characteristics, advantages, and drawbacks. Additionally, we gained insights into categorizing trees and mastering the techniques for traversing them. Throughout the project, we successfully implemented various types of trees, including binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and Max Binary Heap trees.
